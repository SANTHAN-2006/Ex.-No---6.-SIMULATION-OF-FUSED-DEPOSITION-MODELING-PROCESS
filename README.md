## DATE: 27-11-2023
## AIM:
### To simulate the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process.

## REQUIREMENTS:
### System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:
### STEP 1: Click on 'Base'. Base and Build Platform will be displayed on the left side of the screen.
### STEP 2: Click on 'Extruder' then extruder and extruder nozzle will be displayed.
### STEP 3: Click on 'Material Spool' then material spool will be shown.
### STEP 4: Click on 'Filament' then filament will be added.
### STEP 5: Click on 'Start Process' to begin the process.
### STEP 6: After the process is complete click on 'Stop Process' to view product generated using FDM process.

### EXPLANATION :
In Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), the base refers to the build plate or platform upon which the 3D object is printed. It is typically a flat surface that provides stability and support during the printing process. The base is usually heated to ensure proper adhesion between the printed layers and to prevent warping or curling of the printed object. It is an essential component of the FDM printer, as it acts as the foundation for building the layers of the object.
### EXTRUDER

### EXPLNANATION ;
In Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), the extruder is a key component of the 3D printer responsible for melting and depositing the filament material. It consists of a motor-driven gear mechanism that pushes the filament into a heated nozzle. The filament is heated to its melting point, and the extruder moves in a controlled manner to deposit the melted material layer by layer, forming the desired object. The extruder controls the flow and deposition of the filament, allowing for precise and accurate printing. It plays a crucial role in the overall printing process of an FDM 3D printer.
### MATERIAL SPOOL

### EXPLANATION :
In Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a material spool refers to the cylindrical container that holds the filament material used for 3D printing. The spool is usually made of plastic or metal and is designed to securely hold the filament and allow it to unwind smoothly during the printing process. The filament is wound around the spool in a tightly controlled manner to prevent tangling or knotting. The spool is typically placed on a spool holder attached to the 3D printer, and the filament is fed from the spool into the extruder for melting and deposition. Material spools come in various sizes and are available in different materials and colors for printing versatility.
### FILAMENT

### EXPLANATION :
In Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), filament refers to the thermoplastic material used for 3D printing. It is a long, thin strand or thread of material, typically in the form of a spool, that is fed into the 3D printer's extruder. The filament is made of various materials such as ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), PLA (Polylactic Acid), PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol), or nylon. The filament is heated within the extruder, where it melts and is extruded through a nozzle to form thin layers that gradually build up to create a 3D object. Filaments come in different diameters and colors, allowing for a wide range of printing options and customization.

### EXPLANATION :
G-codes and M-codes given to the machine through user interface.As per G-codes and M-codes ,the 3d printer starts to print the 3d model.The print bed is heated and ensures adhesion of base layer of the model.Then the filament from spool is pulled into extruder,where heating element heats filament and deposit it on the print bed.
### STOP PROCESS

### EXPLANATION :
After completion of printing,post processing is carried out to refine and enhance the final object.Once the print is complete, carefully remove the printed object from the build plate.The support material need to be removed from the model.
